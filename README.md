# Candle :candle:
## An open source laser cutter/engraver 

### Hello :wave:
**Candle** is an easy to build diode laser cutter/engraver featuring a diode laser with about 5-15W of power, depending upon the laser module you choose. Candle is sutible for engraving on a variety of materials and cutting thin opaque materials.

### WIP :construction:
The Candle laser is currently a work in progress (WIP) so stay tuned for updates.

### Safety Equipment :goggles:
Never, ever work around a powered laser cutter without wearing appropriate laser safety glasses. These glasses are designed to block the wavelengths of light used by the laser so that the beam does not enter your eyes.

### BOM :receipt:

The affiliate links below help support the project but please feel free to shop around at your prefered vendors. For many parts, you can often find cheaper prices on sites like eBay if you are willing to wait a bit longer for shipping.
